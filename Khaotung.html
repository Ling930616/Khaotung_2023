				Dear Khaotung:<br>
  Although I wasn’t your fans when you debuted.But since I started to warch Thai series in the end of 2022,I was attracted by your smile when you act ” Longtae “ in " นิทานพันดาว ".（That's my first time to see you.)<br>
  <br>
  The smile on your face can really make me a day,and change my mood every single time.<br>
  <br>
  Since than,I've started to follow all of your series and online fans meeting.(online because I've no free time to see you at offline fan meeting)<br>
  <br>
  We all know you always working so hard to improve your acting skill,I can see that on your recent series.<br>
  <br>
  If you feel tired about this,never forget I’ll always be your side and cheer for you from the bottom of my heart.<br>
  <br>
  Last but not least, I hope you can have great mood every day,show your marvelous smile to everybody,and…..HAPPY BIRTHDAY!<br>
  <br>
  (Sorry for my poor english, but I have to say you are really cool and amiable!!!!)<br>
